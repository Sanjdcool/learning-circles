<h4>Sharing (15 min)</h4>

<p>Try to strike a balance between learners sharing something personal that also directly relates to the course material. In the past, public speaking learners have shared speeches they love from YouTube, HTML/CSS learners have shared their favorite website, and Registered Nursing exam prep learners have shared embarrassing stories from nursing school.</p>
<ul>
  <li>First: Ask a learner to introduce a relevant resource/story and, if applicable, explain why the like it.</li>
  <li>Next: Go around the room and hear from each of the other learners.</li>
  <li>Finally: Have a brief discussion about what all the resources had in common,
where peopleâ€™s opinions diverged, and how learning about these might impact the
work learners do in the Learning Circle going forward.</li>
</ul>
