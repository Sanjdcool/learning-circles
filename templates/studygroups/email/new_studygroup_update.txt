{% load i18n %}{% blocktrans %}Hi there {{studygroup.facilitator.first_name}}{% endblocktrans %},

{% blocktrans %}We saw that you created a Learning Circle last week. Amazing!{% endblocktrans %}

{% blocktrans %}The Getting Started section of the handbook (https://www.p2pu.org/en/facilitate/starting/) has lots of tips on how to promote your Learning Circle in your community. Once this is complete, you can check out the Running Learning Circles section (https://www.p2pu.org/en/facilitate/running/) to read facilitation tips and tricks from past facilitators.{% endblocktrans %}

{% blocktrans %}If you have any other questions, or are looking for general support, post your questions in our facilitator community (https://groups.google.com/a/p2pu.org/forum/#!forum/community).{% endblocktrans %}

{% trans "Cheers" %},
