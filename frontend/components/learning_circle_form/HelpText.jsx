      <p>Struggling to choose a course? Ask yourself these three questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><span className="bold">What topics are of interest in my community?</span> If you’re not sure what people want to learn, the <a href="http://info.p2pu.org/2017/06/02/will-people-show-up/" target="_blank">Q Method</a> is a great way to solicit feedback from your community. Be mindful about what knowledge you are assuming people already have when you choose a topic.</li>
        <li><span className="bold">What knowledge gaps exist?</span> Is there a lack of high school equivalency programming in your neighborhood? No good way to get an introduction to web design? Learning circles can be a great way to plug gaps between existing educational institutions.</li>
        <li><span className="bold">What do I want to learn?</span> If you choose something that you are passionate about, your enthusiasm will resonate with the whole group.</li>
      </ul>

    <h4>When should we meet?</h4>
    <div className='content'>
      <ul>
        <li>Six weeks for 90-120 minutes each week is a good default learning circle length. It’s long enough that folks will get to know each other and have time to make noticeable improvements in their skills, but not so long that it is an overwhelming commitment.</li>
        <li>You should allow at least four weeks for promoting your learning circle.</li>
        <li>By default, the learning circle will be at the same time each week. If you need to change a specific meeting time, you can do that from within your learning circle dashboard.</li>

        <li>The welcome message will appear on the learning circle sign up page. You can include a bit about yourself, explain why you’re facilitating a learning circle, or tell participants anything else you think they should know before they sign up.</li>
        <li>If there is any website you want to show learners, such as the homepage for the venue you are hosting the learning circle at, you can also add that here.</li>
        <li>Finally, make your learning circle stand out by uploading a picture or a .gif. It could be related to the location, subject matter, or anything else you want to identify your learning circle with!</li>
